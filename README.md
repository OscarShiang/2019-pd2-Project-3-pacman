# QtPacman
This project is written during the Program Design class in 2019. The whole project is written in C++/Qt and is made to simulate the original game playing.

## How to Play
The pacman can be control using 4 arrows (`up`, `down`, `left` and `right`) and when you eats all the dots in the map, you successfully clear the game. But when you accidently collide into the ghosts, the game will be over. 
And you can use `Esc` to pause the game or return to the menu. 

## The algorithm inside the ghosts
The whole algorithms is referenced from this [website](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php?print=1)

## The resources of the pictures for the characters
All data is modified from the original one on this [website](https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/pacman/)

## Things can be added 
1. The pacman can not turn as the original game does, instead, it turns in right angle as the ghosts do. 
2. There is only ONE life for the player to play, but in the original game, there can be serveral lives for players to play.
3. There is only one level to play, and the speed of the ghosts can not be modified seperately, this is because I try to control all ghosts' move at the top of the game.
